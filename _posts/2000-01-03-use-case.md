There many solution to have a Drupal development for Windows and Mac. They are the [Acquia Dev Desktop](https://www.acquia.com/downloads) avaible for Windows and Mac but there is not a software that allows easly to set-up your environment in Ubuntu. They are alternative like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)  that allows you to created a virtual machine with all your modification.But what if you have a computer with Ubuntu and not a virtual machine. But what if Ubuntu is your OS of preference for development. Do you have to spend hours trying to figure out how to set-up your development? Or you would rather install a shell script and be done with the configuration.
