This project is nothing more that a list of programs (packages) been installed with some pre-configuration. So you can use this project as a set of instruction of what you need to install in order to have a Drupal development environment. In addition you can only install the programs that you need. For instance, if you are back-end developer you probably will not need front-end development packages and visa versa.

In the future this project will have 3 branches. "Master branch" will contain all the packages for full-stack developers. "Desginers branch" - this branch will contain all the packages for designers like yeoman, grunt, Compass, Sass. "Developers branch" - will contain packages for developers like PHP debuggers.
